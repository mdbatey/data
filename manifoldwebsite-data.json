      "description": "Distributed architectures have distinct advantages over monolithic architectures, including robustness to single agent failure, collaboration, and parallelization on tasking. Traditionally, these architectures have come with their own set of drawbacks as well, most importantly a dramatically increased computational complexity. We’re exploring ways to enable swarms of robots to cooperate in a decentralized way, with an emphasis on real-time adaptation to out-of-distribution changes to their environments or scenarios.",

However, there has not been as much research on metacognition in embodied multimodal agents in recent years. By drawing inspiration from human metacognitive capabilities, we aim to define methods of benchmarking similar capabilities in embodied multimodal agents. This will pave the way for eventually developing these capabilities in these agents.",
